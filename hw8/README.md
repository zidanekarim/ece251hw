Review textbook Chapter 4, sections 4.6 through 4.10.

#1 (textbook problem 4.16)
<¬ß4.6> In this exercise, we examine how pipelining affects the clock cycle time of the processor. 

Problems in this exercise assume that individual stages of the datapath have the following latencies:
IF=250ps; ID=350ps; EX=150ps; MEM=300ps; WB=200ps

Also, assume that instructions executed by the processor are broken down as follows:
ALU/Logic=45%; Jump/Branch=20%;‚ÄÇLoad=20%; Store=15%

1.a <¬ß4.6> What is the clock cycle time in a pipelined and non-pipelined processor?

Pipelined: Slowest-stage --> 350ps
Non-pipelined: Sum --> 1250ps

1.b <¬ß4.6> What is the total latency of an lw instruction in a pipelined and non-pipelined processor?


Pipelined: Slowest-stage * 5 --> 350ps = 1750ps
Non-pipelined: Sum --> 1250ps

1.c <¬ß4.6> If we can split one stage of the pipelined datapath into two new stages, each with half the latency of the original stage, which stage would you split and what is the new clock cycle time of the processor?

Split the ID stage bc its the longest, new clock cycle time is 300ps

1.d <¬ß4.6> Assuming there are no stalls or hazards, what is the utilization of the data memory?

20 + 15 = 35%

1.e <¬ß4.6> Assuming there are no stalls or hazards, what is the utilization of the write-register port of the ‚ÄúRegisters‚Äù unit?

45 + 20 = 65%

#2 (textbook problem 4.18)
<¬ß4.6> Assume that $s0 is initialized to 11 and $s1 is initialized to 22.

Suppose you executed the code below on a version of the pipeline from Section 4.6 that does not handle data hazards (i.e., the programmer is responsible for addressing data hazards by inserting NOP instructions where necessary). What would the final values of registers $s2 and $s3 be?
addi $s0, $s1, 5
add $s2, $s0, $s1
addi $s3, $s0, 15

33 and 26 (doesnt update s0)

#3 (textbook problem 4.20)
<¬ß4.6> Add NOP instructions to the code below so that it will run correctly on a pipeline that does not handle data hazards.
addi $s0, $s1, 5
NOP 
NOP
add $s2, $s0, $s1
NOP
NOP
addi $s3, $s0, 15
NOP
NOP
add $s4, $s2, $s1

#4 (textbook problem 4.27)
<¬ß4.8> Problems in this exercise refer to the following sequence of instructions, and assume that it is executed on a five-stage pipelined datapath:
add $s3, $s1, $s0
lw $s2, 4($s3)
lw $s1, 0($s4)
or $s2, $s3, $s2
sw $s2, 0($s3)

4.a <¬ß4.8> If there is no forwarding or hazard detection, insert NOPs to ensure correct execution.
// NOTE from zidane: not really sure how the number of NOPs per instruction works
add $s3, $s1, $s0
NOP
NOP
lw $s2, 4($s3)
lw $s1, 0($s4)
NOP
NOP
or $s2, $s3, $s2
NOP
NOP
sw $s2, 0($s3)


4.b <¬ß4.8> Now, change and/or rearrange the code to minimize the number of NOPs needed. You can assume register $t0 can be used to hold temporary values in your modified code. // NOTE from zidane: not really sure how the number of NOPs per instruction works

add $s3, $s1, $s0
lw  $t0, 0($s4)
lw  $s2, 4($s3)
add $s1, $zero, $t0
or  $s2, $s3, $s2
sw  $s2, 0($s3)

4.c <¬ß4> If the processor has forwarding, but we forgot to implement the hazard detection unit, what happens when the original code executes?
No stalls so garbage values

4.d <¬ß4.8> If there is forwarding, for the first seven cycles during the execution of this code, specify which signals are asserted in each cycle by hazard detection and forwarding units in Figure 4.59.

### 4D ‚Äì Forwarding Enabled, No Stalls (First 7 Cycles)

| Cycle | IF       | ID       | EX       | MEM      | WB       | Forwarding Signals                    | Hazard Detection |
|-------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------------------------------------|------------------|
| 1     | add      | ‚Äî        | ‚Äî        | ‚Äî        | ‚Äî        | ‚Äî                                      | ‚Äî                |
| 2     | lw s2    | add      | ‚Äî        | ‚Äî        | ‚Äî        | ‚Äî                                      | ‚Äî                |
| 3     | lw s1    | lw s2    | add      | ‚Äî        | ‚Äî        | ForwardA = EX/MEM.RegRd == ID.Rs ($s3) | ‚Äî                |
| 4     | or       | lw s1    | lw s2    | add      | ‚Äî        | ForwardB = EX/MEM.RegRd == ID.Rt ($s3) | ‚Äî                |
| 5     | sw       | or       | lw s1    | lw s2    | add      | ForwardA/B = MEM/WB.RegRd == ID.Rs/Rt  | ‚Äî                |
| 6     | ‚Äî        | sw       | or       | lw s1    | lw s2    | ForwardA = MEM/WB.RegRd == ID.Rs       | ‚Äî                |
| 7     | ‚Äî        | ‚Äî        | sw       | or       | lw s1    | ForwardA = MEM/WB.RegRd == ID.Rs       | ‚Äî                |



4.e <¬ß4.8> If there is no forwarding, what new input and output signals do we need for the hazard detection unit in Figure 4.59? Using this instruction sequence as an example, explain why each signal is needed.

Stall whenever there is a hazard, so we would need:

Inputs: 
ID/EX.RegisterRt ‚Äî source reg in EX stage

ID/EX.RegisterRs ‚Äî source reg in EX stage

EX/MEM.RegisterRd ‚Äî dest reg in MEM stage

MEM/WB.RegisterRd ‚Äî dest reg in WB stage

EX/MEM.RegWrite ‚Äî is EX/MEM writing to a reg?

MEM/WB.RegWrite ‚Äî is WB writing to a reg?

ID/EX.MemRead ‚Äî to detect load-use hazard üßå


Outputs:


PCWrite ‚Äî freezes PC during stall

IF/ID.Write ‚Äî freezes IF/ID pipeline reg

ID/EX.Flush ‚Äî flushes EX stage (insert bubble)


#5 (textbook problem 4.30)
This exercise explores how exception handling affects pipeline design. Refer to the following two instructions:
Instruction 1 = beqz $s0, LABEL
Instruction 2 = ld $s0, 0($s1)

5.a <¬ß4.10> Which exceptions can each of these instructions trigger? For each of these exceptions, specify the pipeline stage in which it is detected.

beqz $s0, LABEL -- It's a control hazard but there aren't any exceptions

ld $s0, 0($s1) --   Address, Alignment, or TLB miss in mem stage. 


5.b <¬ß4.10> If the second instruction is fetched immediately after the first instruction, describe what happens in the pipeline when the first instruction causes the first exception you listed in Exercise 4.30.1. Show the pipeline execution diagram from the time the first instruction is fetched until the time the first instruction of the exception handler is completed.

The pipeline stops and the next instruction is flushed

1: IF(beqz)
2: ID(beqz), IF(ld)
3: Exception triggered, flush ld
4: IF(exception handler)
5: continue handler
